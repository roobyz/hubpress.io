One day your company tells you that the analytics team should switch from a proprietary platform like SAS, to something open source like link:http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/[RStudio]. Undoubtedly some analysts may feel excited, while others a bit anxious. How would you get people excited about the switch?

Demonstrate the potential of the new platform, right? How easily can RStudio generate reproducible research and facilitate story telling with data? How can we weave together narrative text and code to seamlessly produce and deliver elegantly formatted analyses to multiple audiences?

Leveraging Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data provided from a link:http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#ixzz3de67BWZU[Groupware@LES] study, a machine learning use-case was born. HAR data has become ubiquitous with the advent of devices like the Fitbit, Nike FuelBand, and even smartphones. Although users of these devices tend to quantify how much they participate in an activity, they rarely consider how _well_ they perform the activity.

This machine learning exercise is a "toy" project in the sense that the Groupware@LES data is well balanced across the class variables. This saves us from needing to account for that, however provides ample opportunity for demonstrating other major analytics steps required in most machine learning projects.

The machine learning goal: can we distinguish between participants in a fitness experiment, that have correctly completed fitness exercises versus those that havenâ€™t and what mistakes were made, if any? We will assess how accurately we can classify the exercises performed by non-participants solely based on their HAR data.
