One day your company tells your team that they should switch from a proprietary analytics platform like link:https://www.sas.com/[SAS], to something open source like link:http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/[RStudio]. Undoubtedly some analysts may become facinated, while others anxious. How would you get people excited about the switch?

Demonstrate the potential of the new platform, right? How easily could RStudio generate reproducible research and facilitate story telling with data? How could we weave together narrative text and code to seamlessly produce and deliver elegantly formatted analyses to multiple audiences?

Leveraging Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data provided from a link:http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#ixzz3de67BWZU[Groupware@LES] study, a machine learning use-case was born. HAR data has become ubiquitous with the advent of devices like the Fitbit, Nike FuelBand, and even smartphones. Although users of these devices tend to quantify how much they participate in an activity, they rarely consider how _well_ they perform the activity.

The class variables were generated by participants wearing HAR devices. They performed "dumbbell biceps curls" in five different ways: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). The results for the class variables are relatively balanced (equally distributed), which simplifies the analysis somewhat. However, there is ample opportunity to demonstrate the other major analytics steps required in most machine learning projects using RStudio.

The machine learning goal: can we distinguish between participants in a fitness experiment, that have correctly completed fitness exercises versus those that havenâ€™t and what mistakes were made, if any? We will assess how accurately we can classify the exercises performed by non-participants solely based on their HAR data.
