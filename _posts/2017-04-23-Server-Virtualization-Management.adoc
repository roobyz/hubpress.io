= Proxmox: Server Virtualization for Work and Play
:hp-alt-title: Server Virtualization Management
:hp-tags: Blog, Open_Source, Technology
:icons: image

Say we want to build a powerful server for the home office and we want good "bang for the buck". We want to run some powerful analytics software which undoubtably requires Linux, and we still want to run Windows. 

== Hardware

1600 Ryzen
NVMe
SSD
Disks
GPU

Ensure you have a reasonably new graphics card and your BIOS has “VT-d” (Intel) or “AMD Virtualization” (AMD) enabled.

== Software

Proxmox is a relatively easy to install solution that fits the bill. It facilitates the creation and connection of virtual "servers" via a PVE Web GUI. We can create and connect to multiple virtual machines; as many as our hardware allows.

=== Optimization


Remove Proxmox License Nag: sed -i.bak "s/data.status !== 'Active'/false/g" /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js

For good performance, we need to configure SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments). The SPICE packages include drivers (QXL and virtio) that enhance virtualization performance:

* SPICE Client (virt-viewer) for Linux, Windows, and Mac systems
* SPICE Guest Tools for the virtual machines
