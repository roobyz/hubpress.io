= Proxmox: Server Virtualization for Work and Play

Say we want a powerful "bang for the buck" home server for games and other system-intensive pursuits. In addition, we may want to run powerful analytics applications which undoubtably requires Linux, but we also want to run Windows. Finally, we want near native 2D and 3D graphics performance inside the guest operating system (OS) while making dual-booting obsolete. 

With the help of ProxMox VE we can achieve all of these objectives. It facilitates the creation and connection of multiple virtual OS "servers" via a PVE Web GUI; as many as our hardware allows. This guide will document a new Proxmox setup, running on the following hardware:

* AMD Ryzen 7 1600 (8 cores, 16 threads @ 3.7GHz)
* 64GB 2400MHz DDR4
* 1x 512GB Samsung 950-PRO NVMe V-Nand SSD 
* Striped-mirrored ZFS storage:
** 2x 1TB Mushkin SSD
** 1x 2TB 7200rpm mechanical drives


== Hardware

We'll need a CPU and motherboard that supports IOMMU to allow hardware virtualization. While most of the computer hardware can be shared between multiple operating systems (OS), the graphics card (GPU) cannot be shared. We'll need at least two graphics cards:

. One GPU for ProxMox (the host);
. One reasonably powerful GPU for your virtual machine (VM) guest (Windows or Linux).

We need to ensure that “VT-d” (Intel) or “AMD Virtualization” (AMD) is enabled in firmware. Since presumably we'll be using our VMs for games and other system-intensive pursuits, it’s a good idea to have 32GB of RAM or more, so that we can reserve at least 16GB for a single VM and still have some left over for ProxMox.

=== Optimization


Remove Proxmox License Nag: sed -i.bak "s/data.status !== 'Active'/false/g" /usr/share/pve-manager/ext6/pvemanagerlib.js

For good performance, we need to configure SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments). The SPICE packages include drivers (QXL and virtio) that enhance virtualization performance:

* SPICE Client (virt-viewer) for Linux, Windows, and Mac systems
* SPICE Guest Tools for the virtual machines

=== Further Tweaks

==== Emulation Settings

In the file: /etc/pve/qemu-server/101.conf

* Update the following: `cpu: Haswell,hidden=1`
* Add the following: `args: ...`

==== GPU Passthrough

https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Pci_passthrough

Identify the video card: 
```
lspci -nn | grep `lspci | grep VGA | cut -d "." -f1` 
```

Take a note of the IDs in the square brackets near the end of each line: in my case 10de:1b80 (graphics) and 10de:10f0 (audio).

```
echo "options vfio-pci ids=10de:1b80,10de:10f0" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```

//Update the grub settings:

//* GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" to:
//* GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet amd_iommu=on"

amd_iommu=on
