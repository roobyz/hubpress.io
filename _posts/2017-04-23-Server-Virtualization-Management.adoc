Say we want a powerful "bang for the buck" home server for games _and_ other system-intensive pursuits. We may want to run powerful analytics applications which would undoubtedly require Linux, but we may also want to run Windows applications. We may want near native 2D and 3D graphics performance inside the guest operating system (OS) while making dual-booting obsolete. Finally, we may want to do all of that from the comfort of our couch using a Windows, Linux or Mac laptop.

== Introduction

With the link:https://opensource.org/[open source] server management solution, link:https://www.proxmox.com/en/[Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE)], we can achieve these goals. PVE enables the creation of multiple virtual OS "servers" via a Web GUI; as many as our hardware setup will allow. This guide will document the setup of Proxmox on the following hardware:

* AMD Ryzen 7 1600 (8 cores, 16 threads @ 3.7GHz)
* 64GB 2400MHz DDR4
* Boot Drive: 1x 512GB NVMe SSD 
* Storage (Striped-mirrored ZFS):
** 2x 1TB SATA SSD (striped)
** 1x 2TB 7200rpm mechanical drives (mirrored)

== Hardware Considerations

Our CPU and motherboard must support "virtualization‚Äù (SVM) and IOMMU, which needs to be enabled in firmware for resource sharing. Also, we should have 32GB of RAM or more, so that we can reserve at least 16GB for a single virtual machine (VM) and still have enough memory left over for ProxMox and potentially other VMs running simultaneously.

While most of our computer hardware can be shared between multiple VMs, the graphics card (GPU) cannot readily be shared. We'll need at least two GPUs:

. One GPU for ProxMox (the host);
. One powerful GPU for our VMs (the guests: Windows, Linux, etc.).

== Software Considerations

link:https://jannikjung.me/proxmox-ve-5-0-beta1/[PVE 5.0] is based in link:https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStretch[Debian Linux (Stretch)]. Since our Ryzen hardware is rather new, our host system needs to have a Linux kernel version 4.10 or later. Although in beta at the time of this writing, PVE 5.0 has better support for Ryzen than PVE 4.4.

PVE natively supports both link:https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page[KVM virtual machines] for hardware virtualization and link:https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/[LXC containers]. Since the guest systems can run under hardware virtualization, we get some added bonuses. For example, we can benefit from Ryzen hardware and still get link:http://www.pcworld.com/article/3189990/windows/microsoft-blocks-kaby-lake-and-ryzen-pcs-from-windows-7-81-updates.html[Windows 7 updates]. We would need to identify our Windows link:https://www.nextofwindows.com/the-best-way-to-uniquely-identify-a-windows-machine[Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)] so that it may be identical on our VM. Otherwise, Microsoft may think that we have a new version of Windows that needs to be registered.

We will use link:https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/faq[ZFS], a storage platform that encompasses the functionality of traditional filesystems, volume managers, and more, with consistent reliability, and performance. Our ZFS installation will be compressed and striped: our two SSD drives will run in parallel and require less storage space, which improves read/write performance. In addition, our ZFS will be mirrored: our SSD drives will be cloned so that we have a backup in case of drive failure.

|*About That*: KVM supports multiple disk formats; raw images, the native QEMU format (qcow2), VMware format, and many more. When working with ZFS on PVE, we need to use raw images. It may not seem obvious at first, but we can easily convert an existing KVM file from one format to a raw image. Near the end of this guide, we'll cover the process to convert a qcow2 format to the required PVE raw image.

This is Part 1 of a multipart tutorial, and a work in progress. Roughly speaking the next parts are as follows. As I complete each part, I'll update the links.
