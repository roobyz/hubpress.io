:hp-tags: Blog, Open_Source, Machine_Learning, Analytics, Data_Science

Say that we are aspiring data scienctists, how do we dip our toes into the the water? How can we get hands-on experience using link:http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/[RStudio] for data science? Start with a Kaggle competition and learn from others, of course!

We are going to use the link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic[Kaggle Titanic "Competition"] as a basis for our introduction to data science using RStudio. Our objective: 

* predict whether or not a passenger would survive the sinking of the Titanic.
* learn how to think about the competition from a data science perspective
* enter a Kaggle submission file for evaluation
* profit!
