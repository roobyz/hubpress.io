= Titanic: Learning Data Science with RStudio
:hp-alt-title: Predict Survival Propensity of Titanic Passengers
:hp-tags: Blog, Open_Source, Machine_Learning, Analytics, Data_Science

So we are aspiring data scientists and want to dip our toes into link:http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/[RStudio]. How do we get started? We dive into the into the waters of the link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic[Kaggle Titanic "Competition"], of course!

Our objective: 

* learn how to think about the competition from a data science perspective
* get somewhat comfortable with RStudio
* predict whether or not a passenger would survive the sinking of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic[RMS Titanic]
* enter a Kaggle submission file for evaluation
* profit!

== Kaggle Basics

Kaggle is a community of data scientists and a platform for facilitating data science journeys. One way to participate, is by entering data science competitions. Similar to other competitions, Kaggle provides two Titanic datasets containing passenger attributes:

* a _training set_, complete with the outcome (target) variable for training our predictive model(s)
* a _test set_, for predicting the unknown outcome variable based on the passenger attributes provided in both datasets.

After training and validating our predictive model(s), we then enter the submission file to Kaggle for evaluation. As we iterate, we can see the progress we make on the leaderboard.

[NOTE]
.*Data Science Perspective*
=====================================
We need to use the provided attributes (variables) to train a predictive model, and how does that work? Some variables are correlated with each other. When those variables vary, the correlated variables will also vary to some degree. We need to:

- maximize the number of explanatory variables: those that are correlated with the outcome variable, and 
- minimize the correlation of explanatory variables to each other (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity[multicollinearity]).

In other words, we need to find the fewest quantity of variables that can explain everything that is going on with the outcome that we want to predict.
=====================================

== Titanic History Lesson

The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank after colliding with an iceberg in the Atlantic on its maiden voyage en route to New York City. It was the largest ship of its time with 10 decks, 8 of which were for passengers. 

There were 2,224 passengers and crew aboard. Of the 1,317 passengers, there were: 324 in First Class (including some of the wealthiest people of the time), 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number of which were in Third Class.

The ship had enough lifeboats for about 1,100 passengers, and more than 1,500 died. Due to the "women and children first" protocol, men were disproportionately left aboard. Also, not all lifeboats were completely filled during the evacuation. The 705 surviving passengers were rescued by the RMS Carpathia around 2 hours after the catastrophe.

== Tutorial Approach

We'll approach this project in multiple parts. This is still a work in progress, but roughly speaking it should look like:

. Part 1: Basic Setup
. Part 2: Feature Engineering
. Part 3: Prediction
. Part 4: Conclusion
