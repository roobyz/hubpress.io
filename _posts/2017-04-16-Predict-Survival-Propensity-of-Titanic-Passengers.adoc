= Kaggle: Learning from Titanic
:hp-alt-title: Predict Survival Propensity of Titanic Passengers
:hp-tags: Blog, Open_Source, Machine_Learning, Analytics, Data_Science

So we are aspiring data scienctists and want to dip our toes into the the water. How do we get started using link:http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/[RStudio]? We dive into the into the waters of the link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic[Kaggle Titanic Starting "Competition"], of course!

Our objective: 

* learn how to think about the competition from a data science perspective
* predict whether or not a passenger would survive the sinking of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic[RMS Titanic]
* enter a Kaggle submission file for evaluation
* profit!

== Quick History Lesson

The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank after colliding with an iceberg in the Atlantic on its maiden voyage enroute to New York City. It was the largest ship of its time with 10 decks, 8 of which were for passengers. There were approximately 2200 passengers across multiple classes from emigrants starting a new life, to the wealthiest people of the time. The ship had only enough life boats for about 1100 passengers, and around 1500 died. Due to the "women and children first" protocol, men were disproportionately left aboard. Also, not all lifeboats were completely filled during the evacuation. The surviving passengers were rescued by the RMS Carpathia around 2 hours after the catastrophe.
